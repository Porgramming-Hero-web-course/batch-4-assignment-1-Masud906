Type guards in TypeScript—using typeof, instanceof, custom type guards, and the in operator—enhance runtime type safety, improve code clarity, and enable TypeScript to handle type narrowing in complex scenarios. Each type guard serves unique use cases, from handling primitives with typeof to working with complex interfaces using custom guards, making TypeScript a powerful language for reliable, type-safe JavaScript.
