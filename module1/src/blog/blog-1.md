Union and intersection types in TypeScript are essential tools for building flexible yet strict code. Union types (|) allow a variable to be one of several types, making code adaptable to multiple inputs, such as a function that can handle both string and number types. This flexibility reduces redundancy and keeps type safety intact.

Intersection types (&), on the other hand, combine multiple types into one, enforcing that an object meets all required type properties. This is invaluable for creating complex structures—like an "AdminUser" that must have both "User" and "Admin" attributes—ensuring that all conditions are satisfied.

By supporting flexible union types and precise intersection types, TypeScript enables developers to write code that is both adaptable and robust, optimizing for safety without sacrificing functionality.
